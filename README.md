# GitHub Repository Explorer

A Next.js + TypeScript application that allows users to search for GitHub repositories, view them as responsive cards, and dive into detailed repo information.  
The app includes **sorting, filtering, search within results, pagination, charts for repo stats, dark/light mode, and responsive UI enhancements**.

## üöÄ Features
- üîç Search for repositories by username  
- ‚≠ê Sort & Filter repos by stars, forks, language, and last updated  
- üìä Repo stats dashboard (stars, forks, languages) using charts  
- üì± Responsive card layout with badges for stars/forks/language  
- üìÑ View repository details including contributors and metadata  
- üìë Pagination with next/prev buttons (extendable to infinite scroll)

cd github-repo-explorer

# install dependencies

### üìñ Documentation & Approach

- Next.js + TypeScript: Provides a scalable, strongly-typed, and SEO-friendly foundation.

- Redux Toolkit (RTK Query): Handles API state management with caching, pagination, and hooks.

- Reusable Hooks: Implemented usePagination and reusable API hooks for maintainability.

- Charts: recharts used for lightweight visualization of repo stats.

- Theming: Tailwind CSS with next-themes ensures adaptive dark/light mode with system preference detection.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs

- **State Management & Data Fetching:** Chose **RTK Query** over plain `fetch` or `axios` for its built-in caching, auto-refetching, and simplified API handling. The trade-off is a slightly steeper learning curve and tighter coupling with Redux.  

- **Data Visualization:** Implemented charts to enhance user engagement and make repository stats more intuitive. This introduces an additional dependency (e.g., `recharts`), which increases bundle size and maintenance overhead.  

- **Pagination:** Currently implemented with **"Load More" buttons** for simplicity and reliability. Infinite scroll was considered for a smoother UX but deferred due to time constraints. This can be upgraded in the future for better scalability.  

- **Search Experience:** A **debounced live search** (fetching as the user types) would improve responsiveness and reduce API calls. However, due to limited time, a manual search trigger was implemented instead.  

- **Known Limitation:** In some cases, after clicking enter repositories may not appear immediately without clicking **"Load More"**. This is due to pagination state handling, which can be optimized with further debugging.

## üåç Scaling for 100,000 Daily Users

### üîê Authentication

**Design**  
- Use OAuth2 (GitHub, Google) for seamless login and reduced friction.  
- JWT tokens (short-lived access + long-lived refresh tokens) for secure sessions.  
- Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.  

**Scalability**  
- Leverage CDN + load balancers for global performance.  
- Use distributed session storage (e.g., Redis) to handle multiple servers.
- Introduce Protocal Buffers in order to read and Write faster

**User Experience**  
- Support passwordless login (email magic link or OAuth).  
- Implement MFA for sensitive operations.

### üîç Search Functionality

**Backend**  
- Use Elasticsearch or Algolia for indexing repositories with autocomplete, faceted filtering, and typo tolerance.  
- Implement caching layers (Redis) to speed up repeated queries.  

**Frontend**  
- Client-side filtering and sorting for already-fetched data.  
- Debounced search inputs to avoid excessive API calls.  
- Infinite scroll pagination for smooth browsing.  

**Optimization**  
- Precompute and cache trending/popular repos.  
- Use GraphQL (via GitHub API v4) for more efficient queries.

### üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

**Monitoring Tools**  
- Prometheus + Grafana for infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, latency).  
- Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking and frontend performance.  
- Datadog / New Relic for APM and real-time tracing.  

**Health Checks**  
- Implement readiness/liveness probes in containers.  
- Auto-scaling with Kubernetes (HPA) based on CPU/memory usage.  

**Maintenance Strategy**  
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployments.  
- Blue-green deployments to minimize downtime.  
- Regular dependency and security audits.

### üìå Future Improvements
- Infinite scroll for repo browsing  
- Favorites system with localStorage persistence  
- Offline support via PWA  
- Gamification (leaderboards, badges)  
- Enhanced charts for repo growth over time
